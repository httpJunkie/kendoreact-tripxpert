      "Barcelona is an excellent place to discover world-class arts and culture. Bullfighting was officially banned several years ago, but the city remains rich with festivals and events. The sights in Barcelona are second to none. Don’t miss the architectural wonder, Casa Mila—otherwise known as La Pedrera. It’s a modernist apartment building that looks like something out of an expressionist painting. Make your way up to the roof for more architectural surprises. And if you like Casa Mila, you’ll want to see another one of Antoni Gaudi’s architectural masterpieces, Casa Batllo, which is located at the center of Barcelona.\r\nTenerife, one of the nearby Canary Islands, is the perfect escape once you’ve had your fill of the city. In Los Gigantes, life revolves around the marina. Take a boat out in search of bottlenose dolphins and whales. For the able-bodied visitor, take a climb up “Cardiac Hill” to get a breathtaking view—and workout. While you’re in Tenerife, visit Mount Teide. It’s the highest point in Spain and the third-largest volcano in the world.\r\n",

      "Touring the East Coast of the United States provides a massive range of entertainment and exploration. To take things in a somewhat chronological order, best to begin your trip in the north, checking out Boston’s Freedom Trail, Fenway Park, the Statue of Liberty, and Niagara Falls. \r\nBring your raincoat to Niagara Falls, which straddles the boarder between Canada and the United States—the majestic sight might have you feeling misty in every sense of the word. Bring your walking shoes to the Freedom Trail. The 2.5-mile walk will take you on an historical tour of sites relevant to the American Revolution. When you visit Fenway Park, you might be wise to bring a helmet. With fly balls that average a speed of 100 miles per hour, you can never be too safe. Bring a healthy set of lungs to the Statue of Liberty and remember to make an advanced reservation if you’d like to climb the stairs to Lady Liberty’s crown. Finish up your tour at the south end of the coast with Kennedy Space Center in Florida and be sure to bring the kids. Everyone will get the chance to touch an authentic moon rock and stand under the largest rocket ever flown.\r\n",

It’s one of South Africa’s Natural Heritage Sites that can only be reached by ferry. Kruger National Park, a nature preserve in the northeastern corner of South Africa, is 5 million acres. It’s not a zoo so you aren’t guaranteed to see certain animals at certain times. But it’s the lack of predictability that makes a safari so magical.

Visit the Taungkalat shrine, home to 37 Mahagiri Nats—animist spirit entities—once so important to the country’s early kings that they would consult the Nats before commencing their reign. You’ll have to climb 777 steps to reach it and you’ll make the journey without any shoes or socks. Tradition is important to the people here in Myanmar. Evidence can be seen in the pious devotees performing deeds of religious merit outside the pagodas. You’ll want to remember to dress conservatively when visiting a temple and remove your shoes and socks before entering a sacred space. A recurring theme you’ll notice is lots of opulent “bling” and gilded spires jetting into the sky. Generally speaking, the cost of your trip will be low but tourist are heavily taxed by the government, so a hotel with extremely modest accommodations might cost you as much as $25 a night.  ",

      "The ancient sights of China are otherworldly. From the Terracotta Army to the cave carvings at Dragon Gate, the immensity of these Chinese attractions is matched only by the diligence in their details. As you travel down the Yi River, the Great Wall, or enter the archeological excavation of 7,000 life-sized warriors and horses created to guard Qin Shi Huang in the afterlife, you may get the feeling that your travels have leapt beyond the geographical—you may feel as though you have traveled through time. \r\nOne of the less whimsical aspects of your travels will take place in the bathroom. Don’t expect toilet paper to be provided. Be sure to carry your own supplies. Similarly, you’ll want to download a language app to help with translation. If you find yourself in a jam, look for a young person to help you translate. Students under 25-years old are most likely to speak English in addition to Mandarin. \r\n",

      "Adventuring through Kenya is no day at the beach. But those willing to brave this raw and wild area of the world will be rewarded with sights and experiences that will last a lifetime. The Great Rift Valley is home to some pretty unique creatures so don’t be surprised if you have moments in which you question whether you are in fact awake or actually dreaming. If you venture to Kenya between July and October, you will be lucky enough to witness one of nature’s biggest wildlife spectacles, the Great Migration. Catch the wildebeests crossing the river from a hot-air balloon while you sip Champaign and don’t be alarmed if you spot a wild lion, leopard or cheetah down below. Take a hike at Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest freestanding volcano on Earth at a staggering four miles high. Don’t worry if you can’t make it to the snow-capped summit, only about 50 percent of hikers are able to reach the top.",

      "The Big Apple is a living city, perhaps more so than any other city on Earth. When people come to New York, they fall in love. Not with some local person, restaurant, building, or bar—they fall in love with the city as a whole. It’s easy to see why when you step back and examine the endless variety of life NYC has to offer. It’s almost like a bag filled with hundreds of Broadway sets exploded and all the charming pieces of this city just fell right into place. A twilight stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge, an afternoon of kite flying (or picnicking) in Central Park, a Broadway show or just a couple hours of wandering through Greenwich Village and you’ll be well on your way to NYC infatuation. Don’t expect to see it all in one trip. That will only leave you feeling exhausted and unsuccessful. Chances are, you’ll want to return soon anyway. This tour packs another city you wouldn’t want to miss – Washington D.C. Prepare to be fully captivated by the Nation's Capitol seen at night and the breathtaking views of the national monuments and federal buildings flooded in lights. The US Capitol Building, the Kennedy Center, the Washington Monument and the Federal Triangle are just a tiny part of everything Washington has to offer.  ",

Istanbul is coated in a texture of beautiful details, giving visitors ornate and tasty souvenirs to take home after their visit. The Eminonu quarter of the Faith district is home to the Spice Bazaar, one of the largest bazaars in the city. Try before you buy and do as the locals do in order to get the most value out of your visit. There will be lots to choose from and you might have trouble differentiating between the high- and low-quality shops otherwise. Greece is, of course, filled with architectural marvels including the Erechtheum, an iconic temple in Athens. The Porch of the Maidens is as distinctive today as it was when it was completed in 406 BC. Ladies, bring a scarf to cover your hair if you visit a mosque. Or, better yet, buy one during your travels to remember your vacation by.",

Many attractions will provide a first-hand look at the sites where some of our world’s most defining moments have taken place—both joyous and tragic. Visit the remains of the Berlin Wall and learn more about the somewhat recent conflicts that tore Germany in two—and the reunification that followed. In Prague, take a lighter look at our recent history with a visit to the architecturally mesmerizing “Dancing House” designed by Croatian-Czech architect, Vlado Milunic and Canadian-American architect, Frank Gehry. Be sure to call ahead and find out if you need an appointment as some of the most historical landmarks can become busy and require reservations for full access to the building or site.",
